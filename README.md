# Course6.00.1x Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming
Problem set, lecture code and finger excercises from the course, written in nim lang.

                                              Hello!

I rewritten code from the course in [nim lang](http://nim-lang.org/) in order to learn 
the language better. I hope you find it useful too!

## Problem Set 1
1. Counting Vowels
2. Counting Bobs
..* Solution using slices
..* Solution using "fast search" algorithm
3. Alphabetical Substrings
..* Alternative Solution

## Week 1
1. Guess and check for square roots

## Week 2
1. Palindrome strings
2. Guess game using binary search
3. Towers of Hanoi algorithm
4. Read and write files
5. Polysum excercise
6. Is char in string using recursion
7. Decimal to binary iteratively
8. Varius recursive functions e.x. fib, gcd, decToBin
9. Find palindrome strings iteratively

## Problem Set 2
Comming Up!
